# Complex API: MOVIE INFORMATION GENERATOR
#### Project Scope: The user enters a movie and it returns the: title, poster, language, runtime, metascore, plot, and trailer. Each time the user enters a movie, the program fetches the JSON response from two movie APIs: the OMDB api that generates the imdb ID number which is then used in the myapifilms API fetch URL to get and display the rest of the information.
